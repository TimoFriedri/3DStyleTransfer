# 3D Style Transfer

This repository provides two 3D style transfer pipelines.




## Code
The source code for the voxel-based Neural Style Transfer and the Eigendecomposition-based style Transfer is organized in two seperate self-contained Jupyter Notebooks.
All information necessary to execute the notebooks is described in the notebooks themselves.
